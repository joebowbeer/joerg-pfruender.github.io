# Given - When - Then

In [my former post](https://joerg-pfruender.github.io/software/testing/2022/08/22/unittests1.html), I've written about naming of tests and structuring the test class.

`Given - When - Then` is the way to structure the body of your test method.

For the `given - when - then` schema Iâ€™ve been inspired by [spock framework&#8599;](https://spockframework.org/spock/docs/2.1/spock_primer.html).
But I believe, it is helpful to structure tests like this regardless of the testing framework or programming language you use:

## Given: 

prepare the preconditions that are necessary for the test to succeed (from a business poin of view)

## When:
call the implementation code (usually one line of code)

## Then:
assert/verify that the implementation did the right thing (try to only have one line of code)

# How to start

Usually: On a new test you start coding the `when` part: You just call the implementation method under test. 

Later when the implementation code evolves then the `then` part will occur and the `given` part will grow gradually.

# Other Names

In the [clean code cheet sheet (page4)&#8599;](https://www.planetgeek.ch/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Clean-Code-V2.4.pdf), this pattern is called "Arrange - Act - Assert". 
But I prefer the words `given - when - then` because they are more widespread ([cucumber](https://joerg-pfruender.github.io/software/testing/2022/01/02/cucumber.html), [spock framework&#8599;](https://spockframework.org/spock/docs/2.1/spock_primer.html), and others ).


**My next post will be about the details of the "given" block. Stay tuned!**
