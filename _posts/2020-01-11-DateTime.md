Java has many classes for dates. 
There are the ancient implementations of java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar. 
Since Java 8 there is the new DateTime library with many Classes. 

But which one should I use? In which Context? 

Here are my favorites:

# [java.time.LocalDate&#8599;](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html)

Use that class if your object is something where the time does not matter. 

Real world example: 

Birthday. Imagine if you had been born in Europe and moved to Australia you would not start celebrating your birthday in the evening because of the location of your birth. 

**It's just the date, no time!**

<br/>


# [java.time.Instant&#8599;](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html)

Use that class if your object is like a technical timestamp. This event occured on the 6th October 2009 at 11:45:34 UTC. 

Instant has no timezone information, so please **treat all Instants as UTC timestamps**!

<br/>

# [java.time.ZonedDateTime&#8599;](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZonedDateTime.html)

When shall we three meet again? Next week, same time!

*Easy! Just add `7*24*60*60*1000` milliseconds.*

Not really! What if there was a switch from daylight saving time on the next sunday?

*Use a `+01:00` after the timestamp to indicate the timezone.*

There are severaltimezones with `+01:00` offset, some with daylight saving time and some without, so...

**Use [ZonedDateTime&#8599;](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZonedDateTime.html) for anything which is like appointment in real life.**

When serializing a ZonedDateTime to a [ISO-8601&#8599;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) string representation, do not forget to add a textual timezone information. The offset is not enough when dealing with recurring events and daylight saving time!  

<br/>

# One more thing...

For unit tests, you might want to simulate something like now we pretend the time is running 5 hours into the future.

You will have some pain to test that using normal methods.

Therefor:

Use a [java.time.Clock&#8599;](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Clock.html) object in your implementation code to construct date/time objects. In the test code, you can then manipulate the clock to simulate the time standing still or running forward.

<br/>

# Last advice

Try to avoid using [java.util.Date&#8599;](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html) and [java.util.Calendar&#8599;](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html) by any means possible.
