When starting as programmer or software developer you might think mastering programming languages will be the most important skill.
Maybe you want to learn as many programming languages as possible. 

From my experience knowing your programming language is basically quite important, but not as much as you think.

There are five things, that are really important to me, and most of them are not really technology and most of them I have not learned at university.

# Type with 10 fingers

I need to admit that I have not learned typing with 10 fingers in some kind of course.
I had to learn playing the piano and so typing with 10 fingers emerged by itself.
Today I really appreciate, that I can type that fast.

*You might say: Software programming is not about typing fast.*

That is true to some extend. But think of one thing: You might be working using a keyboard for twenty or thirty years. How much time can you safe by typing with 10 fingers?
If you attend a class of writing with 10 fingers, it will payout in less than one year, I guess.
If you practice pair programming, then that time won't just be saved only for you, but also for your navigator.
You can easier keep up discussions about the design of your code, because typing does not distract so much.


# Know your IDE shortcuts

For some of you, that read my blog on a regular basis. You will know that I am a big fan of [Intellij IDEA&#8599;](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
Print the [keymap cheat sheet&#8599;](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/intellij-idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard.pdf) and put it next to your keyboard.
Learn the shortcuts by heart, especially the refactoring shortcuts. They will safe you very much time, they will help you refactor without messing and they will still be the same in other programming languages.

# Design Patterns

Read the book ["Design Patterns" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns).
You should know the most patterns and apply them wisely. But please resist to use the [singleton pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern). 

<small>This is the only item on this list, that I've been taught in university.</small>

# Clean Code

Read the book "Clean Code" by [Robert C. Martin (a.k.a. "Uncle Bob")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin).
Make sure you understand the principles and apply them wisely. They are usually a good advice but in some situations they are not appropriate.

# Domain Driven Design
Read the book "Domain Driven Design" by Eric Evans. Make sure you understand the principles and apply them wisely.

# next
If you're done with those, learn the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
and learn about hexagonal architecture.

# Why?

Technologies come and go, some have been there for long time, others had their hype and are forgotten.
I believe those skills will help you on the long run, regardless of which technology you are using.
