You usually want to keep your projects up-to-date to the latest java version. But sometimes that is not possible.

Then you need to switch between different java versions, depending on the project you are working.

# SDKMAN!

https://sdkman.io/ is my recommended tool for the job.

But it has one downside:

In my day-to-day development job I usually don't care much about java's patch versions.
And I usually don't care about using amazon corretto, OpenJDK, Oracle or Zulu java.

I don't want to remember the specific vendor and subversion, I just want some java 17.

This is where "j" comes in:

# j

[j](https://github.com/ldziedziul/j/) is an easy to use, but hard to google script that does a best guess my desired java version.

So I just type

```bash

j 17

```

and I get some java 17.


btw.:

For switching versions of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm I use [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

Happy new year!
