I have been bored to write so much boilerplate code for mocks in unit tests.
That's why some collegues from my former company and I, we have written a [nice little tool](https://github.com/hypoport/MockInjector) to do the boilerplate code. 

I have written a blog post at my former companys blog on its usage:

**[Use MockInjector and package protected scope for dependencies to reduce boilerplate code](https://tech.europace.de/use-mockinjector-and-package-protected-scope-for-dependencies-to-reduce-boilerplate-code/)**


*Update 2019*

Since there has been no activity on the repository since I left the company, I have forked the project:
[https://github.com/joerg-pfruender/MockInjector](https://github.com/joerg-pfruender/MockInjector)
